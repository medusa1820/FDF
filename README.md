https://github.com/VBrazhnik/FdF/wiki/How-to-perform-isometric-transformations%3F


http://www.gandraxa.com/isometric_projection.xml


to do

+ angles as angles, not radians
+ checking files for completeness of rows and columns
+ have a look at checker file of others
    1. wrong file  - extension check
4. handle the maps with colors - drop the colors
5. parallel or conic projection


exp_shrink must be put equal to 1, otherwise while rotating you will receive skewed 3d figure
